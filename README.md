# DSND-dog-breed-classifier

The purpose of this project is to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict dog breeds.  The pipeline is the evaluation of an image as a dog or a human, then a prediction of which dog breed the dog is, or which dog breed the human most resembles.  If the image is detected as neither a dog nor a human, the classifier will not run.

Files included:
